        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>If you want to understand how the Indian stock market may open before 9:15 AM, Gift Nifty is one of the most important tools to follow. Many traders use it as an early signal to plan their trades for the day. This guide explains the history of Gift Nifty, how it works, why it is important for Indian traders, and how Indian users can access it using the <a href="https://bit.ly/tradewill-fx-share-5227300" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tradew App</a>.</p>

        <h2>What is Gift Nifty?</h2>
        <p>Gift Nifty is a futures contract based on India’s benchmark index — the NIFTY 50. It is traded on the NSE International Exchange (NSE IFSC) located in GIFT City (Gujarat International Finance Tec-City).</p>
        <p>Earlier, this contract was widely known as SGX Nifty because it was traded on the Singapore Exchange (SGX). In July 2023 the contract shifted from Singapore to India’s GIFT City and was renamed Gift Nifty. The move helped bring offshore Nifty trading under Indian regulation and strengthened GIFT City as a global financial hub.</p>

        <h2>History of Gift Nifty</h2>
        <p>Before 2023, international investors who wanted exposure to Indian markets commonly traded the SGX Nifty in Singapore. SGX Nifty became popular because it allowed global participation, provided longer trading hours, and reflected global market sentiment.</p>
        <p>To increase domestic control and deepen liquidity inside India, the NSE shifted the contract to NSE IFSC in GIFT City. From July 3, 2023, SGX Nifty officially became Gift Nifty — a notable milestone in India’s financial development strategy.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Why Gift Nifty is Important for Indian Traders</h2>
        <p>Gift Nifty trades for extended hours (roughly 21 hours a day across global sessions). Because of these extended hours, it often reflects:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>US market movement</li>
          <li>European market trends</li>
          <li>Other Asian market sentiment</li>
          <li>Reactions to global news and economic events</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example, if Nifty closed at 22,000 and Gift Nifty is trading at 22,150 before Indian markets open, that usually signals a gap-up opening. That is why traders often check Gift Nifty early in the morning before planning Nifty futures or options trades.</p>

        <h2>Risks Involved in Gift Nifty Trading</h2>
        <p>Gift Nifty is a futures contract and typically involves leverage. This means profits can multiply quickly, but losses can also increase rapidly. Major risks include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>High volatility and fast intraday moves.</li>
          <li>Global macro events that drive large gaps.</li>
          <li>Margin requirements that may change with market conditions.</li>
          <li>Overnight price gaps when Indian markets are closed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Never trade without a clear risk-management plan. Consider using defined-risk strategies or smaller position sizes if you are learning.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Final Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Gift Nifty is a valuable indicator and trading vehicle that helps traders gauge global sentiment ahead of the Indian market open. Since shifting from SGX to GIFT City, the contract has strengthened India’s domestic offering for international hours trading. Platforms like the <a href="https://bit.ly/tradewill-fx-share-5227300" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tradew App</a> have expanded access for Indian users, but futures trading requires careful education and disciplined risk management. Trade responsibly.</p>
